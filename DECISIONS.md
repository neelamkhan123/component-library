# Accessibility Decisions Log

## Button

- Used a native `<button>` element rather than a `<div>` with `role="button"`,
  so keyboard support (Enter/Space activation, focus handling) comes for free
  from the browser instead of being hand-rolled.
- `aria-busy` is set during the loading state so screen readers are told the
  control is mid-operation, since the visible label text changes to "Loading…"
  which alone isn't reliably announced.
- `disabled` is applied during loading too, preventing duplicate submissions
  from repeated activation while an action is in flight.

## Dialog

- Built on the native `<dialog>` element (shown via `showModal()`) instead of
  a hand-rolled `<div role="dialog">`, so focus trapping, initial focus,
  focus restoration to the trigger on close, top-layer stacking, and
  Escape-to-close all come from the browser instead of being reimplemented.
- `DialogContent` requires a `DialogTitle` descendant, which supplies the
  dialog's accessible name via `aria-labelledby`. This mirrors how other
  accessible dialog primitives (e.g. Radix) treat a title as non-optional.
- The native `close` event (fired by Escape or `dialog.close()`) is treated
  as the single source of truth for closing — `DialogClose` and the backdrop
  click handler call the DOM `close()` method rather than setting state
  directly, so every closure path (Escape, backdrop, close button, custom
  trigger) funnels through one state update instead of racing.
- Background scroll is locked (`document.body.style.overflow = "hidden"`)
  while the dialog is open, since the native element doesn't do this itself
  and a scrollable page behind a fixed-position modal is disorienting for
  sighted and screen-reader users alike.
- The open/close fade+scale is pure CSS (`@starting-style` + `transition-behavior:
  allow-discrete`, via Tailwind's `starting:`/`open:`/`transition-discrete`
  utilities) rather than JS-timed classes, so it stays in sync with the
  browser's own top-layer/`display` handling instead of racing it. Every
  transitioned property is dropped under `motion-reduce:` so the dialog snaps
  open/closed instantly for users who've asked for reduced motion (WCAG 2.3.3).
- Note for anyone extending the transition: Tailwind v4 animates `scale`/
  `translate`/`rotate` as their own standalone CSS properties, not through
  `transform` — `transition-[opacity,transform,...]` compiles fine but silently
  doesn't animate a `scale-*`/`translate-*` utility. List the specific property
  (`scale`, `translate`) instead. This only shows up with real CSS loaded and
  computed styles sampled mid-transition; DOM-only assertions won't catch it.

## Drawer

- A drawer is a `Dialog` with different `Content` panel styling — opening,
  closing, focus handling, and labeling are all identical — so `Drawer`,
  `DrawerTrigger`, `DrawerClose`, `DrawerHeader`, `DrawerTitle`,
  `DrawerDescription`, and `DrawerFooter` are the exact same components as
  their `Dialog` counterparts, re-exported under drawer-flavored names. Only
  `DrawerContent` (the native `<dialog>`'s size/position/slide-direction, via
  a `side` prop) is genuinely new. The shared native-`<dialog>` plumbing
  (`showModal()`/`close()` effect, scroll lock, native-close sync) lives in
  `useDialogPanel` in `Dialog.tsx` so both `Content` components stay
  consistent instead of drifting.
- Each `side` pins the panel flush against one edge via `inset`/explicit
  sizing (overriding the `<dialog>` UA default of `width/height: fit-content`,
  which would otherwise just shrink-wrap the content instead of filling the
  edge) rather than centering, and slides in/out with the same
  `@starting-style` + `allow-discrete` + `motion-reduce:` pattern as `Dialog`.
