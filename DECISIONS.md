# Accessibility Decisions Log

## Button

- Used a native `<button>` element rather than a `<div>` with `role="button"`,
  so keyboard support (Enter/Space activation, focus handling) comes for free
  from the browser instead of being hand-rolled.
- `aria-busy` is set during the loading state so screen readers are told the
  control is mid-operation, since the visible label text changes to "Loading…"
  which alone isn't reliably announced.
- `disabled` is applied during loading too, preventing duplicate submissions
  from repeated activation while an action is in flight.

## Dialog

- Built on the native `<dialog>` element (shown via `showModal()`) instead of
  a hand-rolled `<div role="dialog">`, so focus trapping, initial focus,
  focus restoration to the trigger on close, top-layer stacking, and
  Escape-to-close all come from the browser instead of being reimplemented.
- `DialogContent` requires a `DialogTitle` descendant, which supplies the
  dialog's accessible name via `aria-labelledby`. This mirrors how other
  accessible dialog primitives (e.g. Radix) treat a title as non-optional.
- The native `close` event (fired by Escape or `dialog.close()`) is treated
  as the single source of truth for closing — `DialogClose` and the backdrop
  click handler call the DOM `close()` method rather than setting state
  directly, so every closure path (Escape, backdrop, close button, custom
  trigger) funnels through one state update instead of racing.
- Background scroll is locked (`document.body.style.overflow = "hidden"`)
  while the dialog is open, since the native element doesn't do this itself
  and a scrollable page behind a fixed-position modal is disorienting for
  sighted and screen-reader users alike.
- The open/close fade+scale is pure CSS (`@starting-style` + `transition-behavior:
  allow-discrete`, via Tailwind's `starting:`/`open:`/`transition-discrete`
  utilities) rather than JS-timed classes, so it stays in sync with the
  browser's own top-layer/`display` handling instead of racing it. Every
  transitioned property is dropped under `motion-reduce:` so the dialog snaps
  open/closed instantly for users who've asked for reduced motion (WCAG 2.3.3).
