# Accessibility Decisions Log

## Button

- Used a native `<button>` element rather than a `<div>` with `role="button"`,
  so keyboard support (Enter/Space activation, focus handling) comes for free
  from the browser instead of being hand-rolled.
- `aria-busy` is set during the loading state so screen readers are told the
  control is mid-operation, since the visible label text changes to "Loading…"
  which alone isn't reliably announced.
- `disabled` is applied during loading too, preventing duplicate submissions
  from repeated activation while an action is in flight.

## Dialog

- Built on the native `<dialog>` element (shown via `showModal()`) instead of
  a hand-rolled `<div role="dialog">`, so focus trapping, initial focus,
  focus restoration to the trigger on close, top-layer stacking, and
  Escape-to-close all come from the browser instead of being reimplemented.
- `DialogContent` requires a `DialogTitle` descendant, which supplies the
  dialog's accessible name via `aria-labelledby`. This mirrors how other
  accessible dialog primitives (e.g. Radix) treat a title as non-optional.
- The native `close` event (fired by Escape or `dialog.close()`) is treated
  as the single source of truth for closing — `DialogClose` and the backdrop
  click handler call the DOM `close()` method rather than setting state
  directly, so every closure path (Escape, backdrop, close button, custom
  trigger) funnels through one state update instead of racing.
- Background scroll is locked (`document.body.style.overflow = "hidden"`)
  while the dialog is open, since the native element doesn't do this itself
  and a scrollable page behind a fixed-position modal is disorienting for
  sighted and screen-reader users alike.
- The open/close fade+scale is pure CSS (`@starting-style` + `transition-behavior:
  allow-discrete`, via Tailwind's `starting:`/`open:`/`transition-discrete`
  utilities) rather than JS-timed classes, so it stays in sync with the
  browser's own top-layer/`display` handling instead of racing it. Every
  transitioned property is dropped under `motion-reduce:` so the dialog snaps
  open/closed instantly for users who've asked for reduced motion (WCAG 2.3.3).
- Note for anyone extending the transition: Tailwind v4 animates `scale`/
  `translate`/`rotate` as their own standalone CSS properties, not through
  `transform` — `transition-[opacity,transform,...]` compiles fine but silently
  doesn't animate a `scale-*`/`translate-*` utility. List the specific property
  (`scale`, `translate`) instead. This only shows up with real CSS loaded and
  computed styles sampled mid-transition; DOM-only assertions won't catch it.

## Drawer

- A drawer is a `Dialog` with different `Content` panel styling — opening,
  closing, focus handling, and labeling are all identical — so `Drawer`,
  `DrawerTrigger`, `DrawerClose`, `DrawerHeader`, `DrawerTitle`,
  `DrawerDescription`, and `DrawerFooter` are the exact same components as
  their `Dialog` counterparts, re-exported under drawer-flavored names. Only
  `DrawerContent` (the native `<dialog>`'s size/position/slide-direction, via
  a `side` prop) is genuinely new. The shared native-`<dialog>` plumbing
  (`showModal()`/`close()` effect, scroll lock, native-close sync) lives in
  `useDialogPanel` in `Dialog.tsx` so both `Content` components stay
  consistent instead of drifting.
- Each `side` pins the panel flush against one edge via `inset`/explicit
  sizing (overriding the `<dialog>` UA default of `width/height: fit-content`,
  which would otherwise just shrink-wrap the content instead of filling the
  edge) rather than centering, and slides in/out with the same
  `@starting-style` + `allow-discrete` + `motion-reduce:` pattern as `Dialog`.

## Accordion

- Unlike `Dialog`, there's no native element that cleanly covers this: `<details>`/
  `<summary>` only gets exclusive-open grouping via the `name` attribute, has no
  built-in way to animate open/closed, and doesn't map onto a controlled
  `value`/`onValueChange` API without fighting the UA's own open-state handling.
  So `Accordion` instead hand-implements the WAI-ARIA Accordion pattern:
  `AccordionHeader` renders an `h3` wrapping an `AccordionTrigger` button with
  `aria-expanded`/`aria-controls`, and `AccordionContent` is a
  `div[role="region"]` linked back to the trigger via `aria-labelledby`.
- `AccordionContent`'s open/close is animated via a `grid-template-rows`
  transition (`0fr` ↔ `1fr` on a wrapper, `overflow-hidden` on the row inside
  it) rather than transitioning `height`, since `height: auto` isn't a
  transitionable value but `1fr` on a single-track grid resolves to the
  content's natural size and *is*. `motion-reduce:` drops the transition
  entirely, same as `Dialog`/`Drawer` (WCAG 2.3.3).
- A closed item's content stays mounted (at zero height) rather than being
  unmounted, so it's still there to animate open again — but that leaves its
  focusable descendants reachable by Tab and exposed to assistive tech even
  though they're visually clipped by the grid-rows trick, so `AccordionContent`
  sets `inert` on itself while closed. That removes it from both the tab order
  and the accessibility tree without touching `display` (which would fight the
  transition), and is dropped the moment the item opens.
- `type="single"` (default) keeps at most one item open, matching the common
  FAQ/settings-list accordion shape; `collapsible` (default `false`) chooses
  whether activating the already-open item closes it, mirroring `Dialog`'s
  approach of an explicit opt-in prop over a surprising default. `type="multiple"`
  switches to independent per-item state for cases like a multi-section reading
  view where more than one panel should stay open together.
