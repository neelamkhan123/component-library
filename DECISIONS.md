## Button

- Used a native `<button>` element rather than a `<div>` with `role="button"`,
  so keyboard support (Enter/Space activation, focus handling) comes for free
  from the browser instead of being hand-rolled.
- `aria-busy` is set during the loading state so screen readers are told the
  control is mid-operation, since the visible label text changes to "Loading…"
  which alone isn't reliably announced.
- `disabled` is applied during loading too, preventing duplicate submissions
  from repeated activation while an action is in flight.
